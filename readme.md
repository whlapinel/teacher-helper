# Test Data Helper App
by Will Lapinel

## Designed for CMS teachers

## This application:
- Logs in to MasteryConnect, 
- Downloads the data for a test (name provided by user), 
- And then processes the files to provide some basic analysis

## The analysis currently includes:
- Percent tested (combines ML version and Std/Honors)
- Avg Score 
- Percent failed (< 60%)
- Problem questions (questions which less than 60% of students answered correctly)
